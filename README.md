This repository contains sample code for the Reeleezee API. These samples are explained at the [Reeleezee API Documentation ](https://www.reeleezee.nl/developer/docs/api/) site.

**Note**: the samples are a Go learning project and designed for educational purposes.

#### Getting Started
To run the sample programs you need to:

- Have a [Reeleezee administration](https://www.reeleezee.nl)

    "Uri": "https://portal.reeleezee.nl/api/v1",
    "Username": "username",
    "Password": "password"
}
```
The default location for the sample programs should be:
